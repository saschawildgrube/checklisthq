TID_SCAFFOLDER_TEXT_HELP
The scaffolder creates code packages based on template files and your preferences. It can help to create the initial set of source code files that make up a new website or create code that extends an existing website.

The scaffolding process has four steps:

1. Select the category and the actual scaffold to be used.
2. Configure the scaffold. E.g. for a new website, you will specify it's name and root URL.
3. Create and download the zip archive containing the processed template files.
4. Deploy the files in your code repository. In some cases you might have to do more than just adding files. You will find necessary information within the scaffold zip archive.
