=Reference Design Page=
This page serves as a design reference page. It can be used to brief a designer when creating a new web design.

The designer should use this page as part of the design draft and include all following GUI elements.
==Second Level Headline==
This is some text with an internal [[index|link]].
===Third Level Headline===
And even more text including an external [www.example.com link].
====Fourth Level Headline====
Even more text. This time its more text to show how a line break looks like. But for this even more senseless words are required. You expected this loram ipsum thing here. Indeed, that would have been an alternative.
=====Fifth Level Headline=====
And agin more blind text for public amusement.
==Images==
===Floating right===
{IMAGE id="logo" style="floatright"}This is some blind text to demonstrate an image that is floating right around the text. Laram ipsom et cetera. Some more blind text to make the example work.
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
===Floating left===
{IMAGE id="logo" style="floatleft"}This is some blind text to demonstrate an image that is floating left next to a text. Laram ipsom et cetera. And again some more blind text to make the example work.
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
