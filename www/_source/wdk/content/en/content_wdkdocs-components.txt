* Assets - such as images, css files, java script files, fonts, videos, and other files for download)
* [[wdkdocs-components-configurationdata|Configuration data]] - that impacts run-time behaviour but always remains static during operation
* Content files - that represent the "pages" of a website
* Entities - are definitions of database entities and define how data is viewed and edited by users
* [[wdkdocs-components-elements|Elements]] - which render HTML
* Layouts - which are the visual "themes" of {WDK}-based websites
* [[wdkdocs-components-modules|Modules]] - which define used interactions in websites
* Navigation trees - which define menu trees
* (Text) resource files - contain localized text in different languages
* Routes - provide alternative names for content pages if a website supports SEOed URLs
