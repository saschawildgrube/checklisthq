=Publish your {WDK} based project on GitHub=
Every project based on {WDK} that is published on GitHub is a great contribution! This is how it is done:

* Make sure the secret credentials and tokens are not committed to the repository. Check your source code for:
** Database credentials
** Webservice access tokens
** Google Maps api keys
** Any other credentials or api tokens that should not be shared publicly
* Add files /info/exclude. Find some examples [https://github.com/github/gitignore here].
* Prepare repository readme file
** Add information about the project itself
** Add installation instructions including how to set up api tokens and database credentials
** Add a link to the license of your project
* Perform the initial commit
* Update the repository readme file
* Adapt your deployment process: E.g. ignore the .git/ folder and .git* files in your deplyomemt process
* Create an image for social media (ideally 1280 x 640) and add it to the repository
* Define a headline description for the repository
* Define topics for your repository
* Provide a website for the project (if applicable)
