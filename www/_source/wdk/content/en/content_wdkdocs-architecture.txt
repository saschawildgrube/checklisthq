=Architecture=
WDK comes with a strict architecture approach.

This means:
# A web application system consists of separate web applications (e.g. websites and web services) with clearly defined responsibilities
# The internal structure of each web application is well defined - each part has its defined place
# Code and other file assets are organized in a well-defined structure
==Principles==
# Responsibility for security is shared between all web applications
# [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns Separation of concerns]
# Automated testing is a feature, not a step in the deployment process
==Web Application Systems==
A WDK based web application system typically consists of the following web applications:
* Browser facing websites
* Web services with database connections
* Unit test hub
* Installer
