=Websites=
Websites are web applications intended to be consumed by a browser. They respond to HTTP requests with HTML documents, static assets, or responses intended to be processed by scripts executed within a browser.


Websites interact with web services. They never communicate with databases directly.


Websites are responsible to interpret user provided parameters (via GET, POST and Cookie) and generate a response that
# Applies to the demand of the requesting user
# Complies with defined access rights and roles of the requesting user
# Matches the needs of the browser software and the device the browser software is running on
Websites are PHP classes that are derived from CWebsite which is derived from CWebApplication.
